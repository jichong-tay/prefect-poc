    "cd /Users/jichong/projects/playground/BOS/prefect-poc\n",
    "export PREFECT_API_URL=http://localhost:4200/api\n",

    "cd /Users/jichong/projects/playground/BOS/prefect-poc\n",
    "export PREFECT_API_URL=http://localhost:4200/api\n",
    "uv run prefect worker start --pool my-local-pool\n",
    "```\n",

    "### 3️⃣ Trigger a flow run (in a third terminal or from the UI):\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Via CLI:\n",
    "uv run prefect deployment run data-pipeline/my-data-pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "# Or open http://localhost:4200/deployments and click \"Run\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4️⃣ Watch it execute!\n",
    "- The worker terminal will show the flow executing\n",
    "- The UI at http://localhost:4200 will show real-time progress\n",
    "- All logs and results are tracked by the server\n",
    "\n",

    "✅ **Direct execution** (`python flow.py`):\n",

    "- You trigger it manually\n",

    "✅ **Deployments + Workers**:\n",

    "\n",
    "**Blocks** are Prefect's way of storing reusable configuration and credentials. Think of them as secure configuration objects that can be:\n",
    "- Created once and reused across many flows\n",
    "- Stored on the Prefect server\n",
    "- Referenced by name in deployments\n",
    "- Used to connect to external systems (databases, cloud storage, git repos, etc.)\n",

    "- **Git Repository Blocks**: Connect to GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket\n",
    "- **Storage Blocks**: S3, GCS, Azure Blob Storage\n",
    "- **Secret Blocks**: Store passwords, API keys\n",
    "- **Infrastructure Blocks**: Docker, Kubernetes, cloud compute\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Blocks Matter for Private Bitbucket:\n",
    "When your code is in a private Git repository:\n",
    "1. **Worker needs access** to pull the code before running it\n",
    "2. **Credentials must be secure** (not hardcoded in code)\n",

    "## Step 4: Answering Your Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q: \"If I deploy my own Prefect server, how will it connect to the private Bitbucket server?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer: The Prefect server DOESN'T connect to Bitbucket. The WORKER does!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What the Prefect Server Does:\n",
    "- ✅ Stores the Bitbucket credentials (in a Block)\n",
    "- ✅ Stores deployment metadata (which repo, which branch)\n",
    "- ✅ Manages the work queue\n",
    "- ❌ **Does NOT** clone code\n",
    "- ❌ **Does NOT** execute flows\n",
    "- ❌ **Does NOT** need network access to Bitbucket\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What the Worker Does:\n",
    "- ✅ Runs on your infrastructure (can be same server, different server, laptop, cloud VM)\n",
    "- ✅ **NEEDS** network access to your private Bitbucket server\n",
    "- ✅ Pulls credentials from the Prefect server (via API)\n",
    "- ✅ Uses credentials to clone code from Bitbucket\n",
    "- ✅ Executes the flow\n",
    "- ✅ Sends results back to Prefect server\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Worker Placement**: Deploy workers in the same network zone as Bitbucket\n",
    "2. **Credentials**: Use SSH keys or app passwords, not your personal password\n",
    "3. **Least Privilege**: Give the Bitbucket credentials read-only access\n",
    "4. **Network Policies**: Workers need HTTPS/SSH to Bitbucket, HTTPS to Prefect server\n",

    "- **What**: Reusable configuration objects stored on Prefect server\n",
    "- **Why**: Securely store credentials, avoid hardcoding secrets\n",
    "- **How**: Create once, reference by name in deployments\n",
    "- **Types**: Git repos, databases, cloud storage, secrets, infrastructure\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔒 Private Bitbucket + Prefect Architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Component | Role | Needs Access To |\n",
    "|-----------|------|-----------------|\n",
    "| **Bitbucket Server** | Stores your flow code | Nothing (it's the source) |\n",
    "| **Prefect Server** | Stores metadata, credentials, schedules | Nothing (workers connect to it) |\n",
    "| **Worker** | Executes flows | **Both** Bitbucket AND Prefect Server |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 The Complete Flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Developer** pushes code to private Bitbucket\n",
    "2. **Developer** creates Bitbucket credentials Block on Prefect server\n",
    "3. **Developer** runs `prefect deploy` to register deployment\n",
    "4. **Prefect Server** stores deployment metadata (not the code!)\n",
    "5. **Worker** polls Prefect server for work\n",
    "6. **Worker** gets credentials from Prefect server (via Block)\n",
    "7. **Worker** clones code from Bitbucket using those credentials\n",
    "8. **Worker** executes the flow\n",
    "9. **Worker** sends results back to Prefect server\n",
    "10. **You** view results in Prefect UI\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ What You've Learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Blocks** are Prefect's way to store reusable config and credentials\n",
    "2. **Prefect server** never executes code or clones repos\n",
    "3. **Workers** do all the heavy lifting (clone + execute)\n",
    "4. **Network access**: Workers need access to both Prefect server and Bitbucket\n",
    "5. **Security**: Credentials in Blocks, never in code\n",
    "6. **Deployment**: Code stays in git, workers pull it fresh each time\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install `prefect-bitbucket`: `pip install prefect-bitbucket`\n",
    "2. Create a service account in Bitbucket with read-only access\n",
    "3. Create Bitbucket credentials Block on your Prefect server\n",
    "4. Add `prefect.yaml` to your repository\n",
    "5. Deploy: `prefect deploy --all`\n",
    "6. Start workers in your infrastructure\n",
    "7. Watch flows run from your private Bitbucket repo!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember**: The beauty of this architecture is that your Prefect server can be anywhere (cloud, on-prem, DMZ), and your workers just need network access to both the server and Bitbucket. The server itself never needs to reach Bitbucket! 🎯"
