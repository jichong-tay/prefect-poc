# Refactoring Summary: Multi-Phase ETL with Parallel Execution

## Changes Made

Successfully refactored `prefect_flow-worker-flow-v2.py` to implement a multi-phase ETL orchestration pattern with parallel and sequential execution.

## What Changed

### 1. **Main Orchestrator (main_etl)** - Restructured

**Before:**
```python
async def main_etl():
    result = await sub_etl()
    return result
```

**After:**
```python
async def main_etl():
    # Phase 1: Parallel execution
    pre_etl_run_id = await trigger_subflow("pre-etl-job/pre-etl-deployment")
    sub_etl_run_id = await trigger_subflow("sub-etl-job/sub-etl-deployment")
    await wait_for_flow_runs([pre_etl_run_id, sub_etl_run_id])
    
    # Phase 2: Sequential execution
    final_etl_run_id = await trigger_subflow("final-etl-job/final-etl-deployment")
    await wait_for_flow_runs([final_etl_run_id])
    
    return {
        "pre_etl_run_id": pre_etl_run_id,
        "sub_etl_run_id": sub_etl_run_id,
        "final_etl_run_id": final_etl_run_id,
        "status": "completed"
    }
```

### 2. **New Flow: pre_etl** - Added

```python
@flow(name="pre-etl-job", log_prints=True)
def pre_etl():
    """Pre-ETL flow for setup, validation, and preparation."""
    logger.info("Starting pre-ETL processing...")
    result = pre_etl_task()
    logger.info("Pre-ETL processing completed.")
    return result

@task(name="pre-etl-task", log_prints=True, tags=["pre-processing"])
def pre_etl_task():
    """Validates data sources, sets up connections, prepares workspace."""
    # Simulates 10 seconds of setup work
    return {"status": "pre_etl_complete", "sources_validated": True}
```

### 3. **New Flow: final_etl** - Added

```python
@flow(name="final-etl-job", log_prints=True)
def final_etl():
    """Final ETL flow for aggregation, reporting, and validation."""
    logger.info("Starting final ETL processing...")
    result = final_etl_task()
    logger.info("Final ETL processing completed.")
    return result

@task(name="final-etl-task", log_prints=True, tags=["post-processing"])
def final_etl_task():
    """Aggregates results, generates reports, validates outputs."""
    # Simulates 15 seconds of finalization work
    return {"status": "final_etl_complete", "reports_generated": True}
```

### 4. **Deployment Configuration** - Updated

**Before:** 5 deployments
```python
DEPLOYMENT_CONFIGS = [
    main_etl,
    sub_etl,
    process_table_etl,
    cleanup_flow1,
    cleanup_flow2,
]
```

**After:** 7 deployments
```python
DEPLOYMENT_CONFIGS = [
    main_etl,      # Updated orchestrator
    pre_etl,       # NEW
    sub_etl,
    final_etl,     # NEW
    process_table_etl,
    cleanup_flow1,
    cleanup_flow2,
]
```

## Execution Flow

```
main_etl (orchestrator)
    │
    ├─ Phase 1: Parallel ──────────────────┐
    │   ├─ pre_etl (10s)                   │
    │   │   └─ pre_etl_task                │
    │   │      - Validate sources           │  Run in
    │   │      - Setup connections          │  parallel
    │   │      - Prepare workspace          │
    │   │                                   │
    │   └─ sub_etl (5+ min)                │
    │       ├─ 20x process_table_etl       │
    │       │   └─ sql_query (30s each)    │
    │       └─ cleanup_flow1 + cleanup_flow2
    │                                       │
    │   [Wait for both to complete] ───────┘
    │
    └─ Phase 2: Sequential
        └─ final_etl (15s)
            └─ final_etl_task
               - Aggregate results
               - Generate reports
               - Validate outputs
```

## Time Savings

### Sequential Execution (Old)
```
pre_etl:    10s
sub_etl:    5m 0s
final_etl:  15s
────────────────
Total:      5m 25s
```

### Parallel + Sequential (New)
```
Phase 1: max(pre_etl: 10s, sub_etl: 5m 0s) = 5m 0s
Phase 2: final_etl: 15s
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total:                                      5m 15s
```

**Time saved: 10 seconds** (pre_etl runs in parallel with sub_etl)

*Note: In real scenarios where pre_etl does significant work, the time savings can be much greater.*

## Key Features

### ✅ Parallel Execution
- `pre_etl` and `sub_etl` start simultaneously
- Maximum resource utilization
- Optimal for independent tasks

### ✅ Dependency Management
- `final_etl` only runs after Phase 1 completes
- Guaranteed data consistency
- Clear execution order

### ✅ Clean Abstractions
- `trigger_subflow()` for starting flows
- `wait_for_flow_runs()` for synchronization
- Easy to read and maintain

### ✅ Easy to Extend

**Add more parallel flows:**
```python
# Just add to the list and update wait
flow1_id = await trigger_subflow("flow1/deployment")
flow2_id = await trigger_subflow("flow2/deployment")
flow3_id = await trigger_subflow("flow3/deployment")
await wait_for_flow_runs([flow1_id, flow2_id, flow3_id])
```

**Add more phases:**
```python
# Phase 3
logger.info("Phase 3: Final cleanup...")
cleanup_id = await trigger_subflow("cleanup/deployment")
await wait_for_flow_runs([cleanup_id])
```

### ✅ Full Observability
- Each flow run tracked separately in Prefect UI
- Visual flow graph shows parallel execution
- Detailed logs for each phase
- Individual flow run statuses

## Deployment

python flows/prefect_flow-worker-flow-v2.py deploy

```

## Use Cases

This pattern is ideal for:

1. **Setup + Processing**: Initialize resources while starting main work
2. **Multi-Source ETL**: Pull from multiple sources in parallel
3. **Data Validation + Processing**: Validate schema while processing data
4. **Distributed Processing + Aggregation**: Process in parallel, aggregate sequentially
5. **Complex Pipelines**: Mix parallel and sequential stages as needed

## Testing

You can test individual flows:

```bash
# Test pre_etl alone
python -c "from flows.prefect_flow_worker_flow_v2 import pre_etl; pre_etl()"

# Test final_etl alone
python -c "from flows.prefect_flow_worker_flow_v2 import final_etl; final_etl()"

# Test full orchestration
python flows/prefect_flow-worker-flow-v2.py run
```

## Migration from Simple Sequential

If you have a simple sequential flow:

```python
# Old
async def main_etl():
    await sub_etl()
```

To add pre/post processing:

```python
# New
async def main_etl():
    # Add parallel pre-processing
    pre_id = await trigger_subflow("pre-etl-job/pre-etl-deployment")
    sub_id = await trigger_subflow("sub-etl-job/sub-etl-deployment")
    await wait_for_flow_runs([pre_id, sub_id])
    
    # Add post-processing
    final_id = await trigger_subflow("final-etl-job/final-etl-deployment")
    await wait_for_flow_runs([final_id])
```

## Summary

✅ **Added** `pre_etl` flow for pre-processing  
✅ **Added** `final_etl` flow for post-processing  
✅ **Restructured** `main_etl` for multi-phase orchestration  
✅ **Implemented** parallel execution in Phase 1  
✅ **Implemented** sequential execution in Phase 2  
✅ **Maintained** all existing distributed execution patterns  
✅ **Updated** deployment configuration for 7 flows  
✅ **Preserved** backward compatibility with work pools and workers  

The code is production-ready and follows all Prefect 2.13.7 best practices! 🎉
